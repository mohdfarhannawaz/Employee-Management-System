# Employee Management System - Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Syntax Error in Login Component**

- **File**: `src/components/Auth/Login.jsx`
- **Issue**: Malformed JSX on line 23 with broken text content
- **Fix**: Removed the broken text and fixed the className attribute

### 2. **Admin Email Mismatch**

- **Files**: `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/Auth/Login.jsx`, `src/components/other/Header.jsx`
- **Issue**: Admin email was inconsistent across files (`admin@me.com` vs `admin@example.com`)
- **Fix**: Standardized to use `admin@example.com` throughout the application

### 3. **Missing Task Data Properties**

- **File**: `src/utils/localStorage.jsx`
- **Issue**: Several tasks were missing required properties like `id`, `priority`, `createdAt`, and `assignedTo`
- **Fix**: Added missing properties to all tasks in the localStorage data

### 4. **Component Props Mismatch**

- **File**: `src/components/Dashboard/EmployeeDashboard.jsx`
- **Issue**: TaskList and TaskListNumbers components were receiving incorrect props
- **Fix**:
  - Changed `TaskList data={filteredData}` to `TaskList tasks={filteredData?.tasks || []} id={filteredData?.id}`
  - Changed `TaskListNumbers data={props.data}` to `TaskListNumbers taskCounts={props.data?.taskCounts}`

### 5. **React Hooks Order Issue**

- **File**: `src/components/other/EmployeeManagement.jsx`
- **Issue**: React hooks were being called conditionally after an early return
- **Fix**: Moved all useState hooks to the top of the component before any conditional returns

## Application Features

### Admin Dashboard

- **Login**: `admin@example.com` / `123`
- **Features**:
  - Create new tasks and assign to employees
  - View all tasks across all employees
  - Manage employees (add, edit, delete)
  - View analytics and performance metrics

### Employee Dashboard

- **Login**: Use any employee email from the data (e.g., `e@e.com` / `123`)
- **Features**:
  - View assigned tasks with filtering and search
  - Accept new tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed or failed
  - View task statistics

### Demo Credentials

- **Admin**: `admin@example.com` / `123`
- **Employee**: `e@e.com` / `123` (or any other employee email)

## Technical Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Added proper null checks and loading states
2. **Data Consistency**: Ensured all task data has required properties
3. **Component Structure**: Fixed prop passing between components
4. **React Best Practices**: Fixed hooks order and removed unused imports
5. **UI/UX**: Maintained the existing beautiful design with proper error states

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
4. Use the demo credentials to test both admin and employee views

The application is now fully functional with no linting errors and should display properly without any blank screens.
